# AWS - Remote Patient Monitoring System
Real-time Remote Patient Monitoring System built on AWS.

This repository contains the architecture and implementation details for a real-time Remote Patient Monitoring System built on AWS. The system is designed to continuously ingest patient vitals, automatically detect health anomalies, and provide instant alerts to healthcare providers.

The primary objective is to build a scalable and reliable healthcare data processing pipeline that reduces manual work for hospitals through automation.

Key benefits include:
1. Early Anomaly Detection: Immediate identification of critical health events.
2. Continuous Monitoring: Real-time tracking of patient vital signs.
3. Secure Storage: Reliable and encrypted storage of sensitive patient records
